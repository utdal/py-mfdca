def MapSeq2hmmProfile(hmmFile, Sequence2Align, whichHit=1) -> dict:
    """
    Align a protein sequence to a profile HMM using pyhmmer and build a mapping dictionary.

    This function loads a protein sequence from a FASTA file and a profile HMM from an HMMER3 file,
    performs a profile-sequence alignment using pyhmmer.hmmscan, and constructs a dictionary mapping
    HMM match state positions to the corresponding positions in the target sequence.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hmmFile : str or Path
        Path to the HMMER3 profile HMM file (e.g., 'PF10531.hmm').
    Sequence2Align : str or Path
        Path to the FASTA file containing the amino acid sequence to align.

    Returns
    -------
    mapping : dict
        A dictionary where keys are 1-based HMM match state positions and values are 1-based positions
        in the target sequence. Only aligned (non-gap, non-insert) positions are included.

    Notes
    -----
    - The function assumes there is only one sequence in the FASTA file and one significant domain hit.
    - The mapping is useful for relating MSA/HMM positions to PDB or other sequence coordinates.
    - Requires pyhmmer to be installed and available in the Python environment.

    Example
    -------
    >>> mapping = MapSeq2hmmProfile("PF10531.hmm", "3M9S_1.fasta")
    >>> print(mapping)
    {1: 3, 2: 4, 3: 5, ...}

    Map a nucleotide sequence to an HMM profile via its translated protein sequence.

    This function:
      1. Translates a nucleotide FASTA to protein.

      3. Builds a mapping from HMM match states to nucleotide codons.
      4. Writes aligned protein and nucleotide sequences to disk.

    ----------

    NucSequence2Align : str or Path
        Path to the nucleotide FASTA file.
