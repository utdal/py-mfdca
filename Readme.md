# Direct Coupling Analysis for Python

## mfDCA implementation, adapted from MATLAB version (http://dca.rice.edu/portal/dca/)

[Direct Coupling Analysis](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1111471108) was developed using MATLAB. This is a python port.

Unit testing Readme and script details output differences from original MATLAB script.

## Installation

The simplest way to install is:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/utdal/py-mfdca.git
```

Or clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/utdal/py-mfdca.git
pip install .
```
This installs all core functionality and unit tests.

_Note for Windows users_:

By default, the package includes Unix-specific tools using pyhmmer, which are not supported on Windows. These will be automatically excluded during installation on Windows.

If you are on Linux, macOS, or WSL, no special action is needed.

If youâ€™re on Windows and wish to force-install Unix tools (e.g., using WSL), you can run:


```bash
pip install .[unix]
```

Example Usage: 

```python
from dca.dca_class import dca
protein_family = dca('sequence_file')
protein_family.mean_field()
protein_family.DI # contains DI scores for each pair
protein_family.couplings # NxNxqxq matrix of couplings (eij)
protein_family.localfields # Nxq matrix of localfields (h)
protein_family.compute_Hamiltonian('sequence_file') # returns (Hamiltonians,sequence_headers) for input sequences
```
Runtimes, Random MSA Average of 2 (M1 Pro, 16GB RAM):

| Sequence Length | # of sequences | Runtime (s) | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 100 | 1,000 | 2.2 | 
| 300 | 1,000  | 5.4 | 
| 500 | 1,000 | 21 |
| 100 | 10,000  | 0.7 |
| 300 | 10,000  | 6.7 |
| 500 | 10,000 | 24.1 |
| 100 | 100,000  | 98.5 |
| 300 | 100,000  | 266.8 |
| 500 | 100,000 | 391 |

## Optional: HMMER Tools (Unix Only)

This package includes a Unix-specific module `dca.hmm_tools` for sequence analysis using [pyhmmer](https://github.com/althonos/pyhmmer).

This module is:
- Enabled by default on Unix systems (Linux/macOS)
- Disabled on Windows
- Can be imported as `from dca import hmm_tools`

Attempting to import or use this module on Windows will raise an `ImportError`.
